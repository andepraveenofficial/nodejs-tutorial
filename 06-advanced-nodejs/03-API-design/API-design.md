## REST APIs
* REST APIs play an important role in ensuring smooth communication between the client and the server.
* You can think of the client as the front end and the server as the back end.
* Communication between the client (frontend) and the server (backend) isn't usually super direct. So we use an interface called an Application Programming Interface (or API) to act as an intermediary between the client and the server.


### REST 
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

<summary>Best Practices</summary>

## Best Practices

1. Use Nouns for Resources
   * Correct: /users, /orders
   * Incorrect: /getUsers, /createOrder

2. Use HTTP Methods Appropriately
   * GET: Retrieve data
   * POST: Create a new resource
   * PUT: Update a resource
   * DELETE: Delete a resource
   * PATCH: Partially update a resource
3. Use Plural Nouns
   * Correct: /books, /users
   * Incorrect: /book, /user
4. Use Logical Resource Nesting
   * Correct: /users/{userId}/orders
   * Incorrect: /ordersByUser/{userId}
5. Use HTTP Status Codes
   * 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
   * 201 Created: Successful POST
   * 204 No Content: Successful DELETE (no response body)
   * 400 Bad Request: Invalid data in request
   * 401 Unauthorized: Authentication failure
   * 403 Forbidden: Authorization failure
   * 404 Not Found: Resource not found
   * 500 Internal Server Error: Server error
6. Use Query Parameters for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination
   * Filtering: /users?role=admin
   * Sorting: /users?sort=createdAt
   * Pagination: /users?page=2&limit=10
7. Consistent and Meaningful Error Responses
   * 
```js
{
  "error": "Resource not found",
  "details": "The user with ID 123 does not exist."
   }
```
8. Version Your API
   * Include a version number in your URL:
   * /v1/users
   * /v2/users
   * Example: /api/v1/users
