# Microservices vs Monolith

### Project Flow
1. Requirements -> Project Manager
2. Design -> Senior Engineer / Architecture
3. Development -> Developers, SDE1, SDE2
4. Testing -> Testers
5. Deployment -> Devops Team
6. Maintenance -> Another Company

### SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
- waterfall model

### Architecture
1. Monolith
2. Microservices

### 1. Monolith
Database + Backend + Frontend -> all code write in a single code repository.


### 2. Microservices
- If error in code then only that microservice will break.
1. database
2. Backend
3. Frontend
- All are maintained different code repositories.
- Everything maintain as a different projects.

### monolith vs microservices
1. Dev Speed
2. Code Repo
3. Scalability
4. Deployment
5. Tech Stack
6. Infra Cost
7. Complexity
1. Fault Isolation
2. Testing
3. Ownership
4. Maintenance
5. Rewamps
6. Debugging
7. Dev Experience
