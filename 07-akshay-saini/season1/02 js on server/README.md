### Server
- Server is a remote computer (working remotely)
- website is working on a server, It means website working somebody computer (remotely).
- End of the day Server is a machine or cpu which is receiving a request.
- Every domain name mapping with a IP (every machine has ip).
- Server means a Machine.

### History
- V8 JS Engine is developed by Google
- V8 written in C++
- JS code uses a C++ to execute a Javascript Code
- JS engine is a piece of code you check in v8 github repository.
- End of the day JS engine is a C++ code.

### V8
- V8 Engine work is execute a JS code
- JS -> V8 (c++) -> Machine Code
- NodeJS is a C++ application with V8 embedded into it.
- V8 Engine written in C++ and It follows the ECMA script standards.
- V8 Engine cannot go outside of the ECMA script standards. 
- Engine is a piece of code thats all.

### ECMA script
- ECMA script follows Creates standards or rules
- Example : `var a = 10;`
- javascript follows ECMA script standards.
- ECMA script has some rules, So here Javascript following the ECMA script rules.
- Example : ECMA script standards are `loose equal (==)`, `strict equal (===)`
- Most of the JS Engines follows these standards.

- V8 -> Google
- SpiderMonky -> Firefox
- Chakra -> Microsoft Edge
- JS Core -> Safari

- Every JS Engines work is takes JSCode and convert into Machine Code
- Javascript Engine Follows the ECMA script rules (JS coding format).

- ES6 -> 6 version is ECMA Script
- ECMA is a documentation of Javascript.
- All the JS Engines follow the ECMA script standards.

### NodeJS
- NodeJS is Javascript Runtime
- NodeJS has V8 Engine and Super Powers
1. V8 Engine
2. Super Powers
- NodeJS -> V8 + Super powers

### NodeJS Super Powers
- NodeJS gives some APIs 
- V8 job only execute core Javascript ECMA script standards code
- V8 cannot go into filesystem
- V8 cannot connect to Database
- V8 cannot fetch the image from the folder
- Super Powers mostly written in Javascript
- Whole Nodejs -> C++ , js languages

### why V8 is a C++ code ?
- Computer understands binary code
