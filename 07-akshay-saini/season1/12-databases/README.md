### SQL vs MongoDB
- If you not store data in a particular field, then in SQL it takes some memory. If you want to add another column that is not easy..If we leave some fields as empty it takes some null values, it takes memory.
- We can leave some fields there is no problem, it does not consume any memory. we can easily add some fields.
- SQL has fixed schema, It means fixed columns.
- SQL tough to do horizontal scaling.
